![BETTER SLABS](https://github.com/Eilux/BetterSlabs/blob/master/src/main/resources/icon.png "BETTER SLABS!")
A Fabric mod for improving slabs.
## About
This mod uses Mixins to change the behavior of vanilla slabs in order to add side varients of them. It will automatically add vertical versions of all vanilla and modded slabs. Unlike other mods vertical slabs are not a seperate item and are integrated into regular slab behavior.
